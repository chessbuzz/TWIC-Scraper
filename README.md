# TWIC-Scraper
Python code to scrape the TWIC site for new PGNs


Original Python code from:
https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/4188/what-is-the-best-way-to-get-games-for-the-multiple-editions-of-the-week-in-chess

Added HTTPS support, since TWIC website has a permanent redirect to the https version of the site.
